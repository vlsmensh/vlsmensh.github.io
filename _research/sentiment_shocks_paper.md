<strong>Abstract:</strong> In this study, I leverage the comovement in households' expectations to identify boundedly rational shocks that shift the entire system of their beliefs about the economy -- sentiment shocks. The estimated shock series is correlated with consumer sentiment measures and remains distinct from standard macroeconomic shocks. My empirical analysis shows that sentiment disturbances have large and long-lived impacts on household consumption, with the response of durable good spending being especially strong. Sentiment shocks account for over 30% of the volatility in durable consumption and around 20% in non-durables at horizons of one to two years. I extend an otherwise standard New Keynesian model by introducing sentiment shocks that trigger a deviation of expectations from the rational benchmark. I present analytical results demonstrating that, depending on parameter values, a positive sentiment shock can generate fluctuations of either sign in output, inflation or the interest rate. The parameter estimates suggest that the high persistence of sentiment disturbances gives rise to long-lived effects on the model economy, consistent with the empirical impulse responses. Based on the estimated parameters, my quantitative results imply that the equilibrium effects of sentiment shocks on output and inflation are primarily driven by expectations of future interest rate changes. The latter reflects the anticipated monetary policy reaction to expected fluctuations in output arising from sentiment disturbances.
