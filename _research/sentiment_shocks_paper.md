<strong>Abstract:</strong> In this study, I leverage the comovement in households' expectations to identify shocks that shift the entire system of their beliefs about the economy -- sentiment shocks. The estimated shock series is correlated with consumer sentiment measures, and distinct from standard macroeconomic disturbances found in the literature. My empirical analysis shows that sentiment shocks have large and long-lived impacts on household consumption, with the response of durable good spending being especially strong. Sentiment shocks can account for over 30\% of the volatility in durable consumption and around 20\% in non-durables at horizon of one to two years. I augment an otherwise standard New Keynesian model with sentiment shocks that trigger a deviation of expectations from the rational benchmark. I present an analytical result to show that the proposed version of the model can generate output fluctuations of either sign in response to a positive sentiment shock. The estimated parameters suggest that sentiment disturbances have non-negligible effects on the dynamics of macroeconomic variables. Given these parameter estimates, my quantitative results imply that the equilibrium effects of sentiment shocks on aggregate output and inflation are primarily driven by expectations of future interest rate changes induced by the monetary policy reaction to cyclical movements in output.
