This paper identifies sentiment shocks from households’ inflation expectations by 
imposing a set of zero and sign restrictions in Structural Vector Autoregression. This
shock reflects movements in economic agents’ “animal spirits”, gives rise to excessive
pessimism or optimism about an economic outlook in their minds and rationalizes a
departure of households’ and firms’ expectations from rationality. I quantify aggregate
fluctuations triggered by the sentiment shock and find that depressed sentiments lead
to a persistent decline in economic activity and an unusual S-shaped dynamics of
inflation. One candidate mechanism that can explain these effects, operates through a
decline in spending on durable goods. The shock best explains medium run volatility
of the unemployment rate, industrial production and consumption, contributes more
to short term fluctuations of inflation expectations and accounts for a similar share of
variance of realized inflation at both short and medium run frequencies.
